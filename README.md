# Weather-App-Public

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with working with an API, I have a lot of ideas for other projects that require API and I wanted to use this weather app as the foundation for my learning.

I learnt how to use my new understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript to build new project and most importantly I added the ability to work with APIs
